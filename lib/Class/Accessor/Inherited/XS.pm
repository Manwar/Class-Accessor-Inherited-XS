=head1 NAME

Class::Accessor::Inherited::XS - Fast XS inherited and class accessors

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  #install accessors at compile time
  use Class::Accessor::Inherited::XS 
      inherited => [qw/foo bar/], # inherited accessors with key names equal to accessor names
      class     => [qw/baz/],     # an anonymous non-inherited accessor for __PACKAGE__
      varclass  => [qw/boo/],     # non-inherited accessor for __PACKAGE__,  aliased with 'our $boo' variable
  ;
  
  use Class::Accessor::Inherited::XS { # optional braces
      inherited => {
        bar => 'bar_key',
        foo => 'foo_key',
      },
      class     => ['baz'],
      varclass  => ['boo'],
  };
  
  #or in a Class::Accessor::Grouped-like fashion
  use parent 'Class::Accessor::Inherited::XS';
  
  __PACKAGE__->mk_inherited_accessors('foo', ['bar', 'bar_key']);
  __PACKAGE__->mk_class_accessors('baz');
  __PACKAGE__->mk_varclass_accessors('boo');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides a very fast implementation for 'inherited' accessors, that were introduced
by the L<Class::Accessor::Grouped> module. They give you a capability to override values set in
a parent class with values set in childs or object instances. Generated accessors are compatible with
L<Class::Accessor::Grouped> generated ones.

Since this module focuses primary on speed, it provides no capability to have your own per-class
getters/setters logic (like overriding L<get_inherited>/L<set_inherited> in L<Class::Accessor::Grouped>),
but it gives you an ability to register a single get/set callback for you own accessor types.

It also provides two types of non-inherited accessors - 'class' and 'varclass' with the only difference
that 'varclass' internal storage is an alias to a package variable of the same name. They always give you
package value, even when called on an object.

=head1 UTF-8

Starting with the perl 5.16.0, this module provides full support for UTF-8 method names and hash 
keys. Before that, you can't distinguish UTF-8 strings from bytes string in method names, only in 
hash keys. You have been warned.

=head1 THREADS

Though highly discouraged, perl threads are supported by L<Class::Accessor::Inherited::XS>. You may
have accessors with same names pointing to different keys in different threads, etc. There are
no known conceptual leaks.

=head1 PERFORMANCE

L<Class::Accessor::Inherited::XS> is at least 10x times faster than L<Class::Accessor::Grouped>, depending
on your usage pattern. Accessing data from a parent in a large inheritance chain is still the worst case,
but even there L<Class::Accessor::Inherited::XS> beats L<Class::Accessor::Grouped> best-case.

Here are results from a benchmark run on perl 5.20.1 (see bench folder):

    package MyAccessor;
    # 'register_type' isn't exported
    Class::Accessor::Inherited::XS::register_type(
        inherited_cb => {on_read => sub {}, on_write => sub{}},
    );

    package MyClass;
    use MyAccessor;
    use Class::Accessor::Inherited::XS {
        inherited    => ['foo'],
        inherited_cb => ['bar'],
    };

You can register new inherited accessor types with associated read/write callbacks. They're still
'inherited', but you can modify return values. Those new types can be installed using
the L<Class::Accessor::Inherited::XS> import() call. Unlike L<Class::Accessor::Grouped>,
here's a single callback per accessor type, without any inheritance lookups for get_*/set_* functions.

B<on_read> callback gets a single argument - from a normal 'inherited' accessor. It's return value is a new
accessor's return value (and is not stored anywhere).

B<on_write> callback gets two arguments - original args from the accessor's call. It's return value is saved
instead of the user's supplied one. Exceptions thrown from this callback will cancel store and leave old value unchanged.

=head1 PROFILING WITH Devel::NYTProf

To perform it's task, L<Devel::NYTProf> hooks into the perl interpreter by replacing default behaviour for calling subroutines
on the opcode level. To squeeze last bits of performance, L<Class::Accessor::Inherited::XS> does the same, but separately
on each call site of its accessors. It turns out into CAIX favor - L<Devel::NYTProf> sees only first call to CAIX
accessor, but all subsequent ones become invisible to the subs profiler.

Note that statement profiler still correctly accounts time spent on a line, you just don't see time spent in accessors'
calls separately. That's sometimes OK, sometimes not - you get profile with all possible optimizations on, but it's hard for understanding.

Since it's hard to detect L<Devel::NYTProf> (and any other module doing such magic) in a portable way (all hail Win32), there's
an %ENV switch available - you can set CAIXS_DISABLE_ENTERSUB to a true value to disable call site optimization and get full subs profile.
